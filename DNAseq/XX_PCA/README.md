PCA

population genetics? is it a good idea? questionable. 

The goal of a PCA is to try to cluster samples in how ever many degrees of a "principle component" that explains X% of variation among the samples while reducing noise. It's basically a visual check (and should be used as one). It transforms some correlated features in data into orthogonal components. PCA uses eigen-decomposition to breakdown a matrix where we get a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues (the dimension of the matrix) and a matrix formed by the eigenvectors.

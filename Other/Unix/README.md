## Compressing
Once you are all done with your data, it is probably best to compress a directory into a tarball:

```tar -czvf folderName.tar.gz *folderName```

This can take daaaays! 

You can also use zip, unzip to compress and extract files from a zip archive. 

## Visual Text Editor
To edit any text files, you can either do it manually through notepad, and then reupload them to the cluster (straightforward, but annoying when you have a lot to edit) or you can download vim to edit your text files (which will mostly be your .sh files). To get out of the vim editor use `:q` and hit enter. 

## Screens 
Useful tool, basically like running another terminal, but can be done in the background. Run this on a screen 
Screen -r (if there are any screens that are running)
Type in screen 
Paste the command 
Control + a +d 
Then it goes back 
Reaccess screen â€“ screen -r 
Type exit to get out of it

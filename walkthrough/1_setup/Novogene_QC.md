Statistics of Sequencing Data
1. Sample name
2. Lane: The flowcell ID and lane number during the sequencing (FlowcellID_LaneNumber).
3. Raw bases(bp): The original sequence data volume, (Raw reads) * (sequence length), calculating in bp.
4. Clean bases(bp): The sequence data volume calculated by clean data, (Clean reads) * (sequence length), calculating in bp.
5. Effective (%): The ratio of clean data to raw data.
6. Error (%): Overall error rate of base.
7. Q20 (%): The percentage of bases with higher Phred score than 20.
8. Q30 (%): The percentage of bases with higher Phred score than 30.
9. GC: The percentage of G and C in the total bases.

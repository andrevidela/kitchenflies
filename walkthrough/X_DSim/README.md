for the sam to bam crap F1_22: 101393 reads could not be matched to a mate and were not exported


Output will be in /mnt/shared/scratch/vlitzke//kitchenflies/DNA/2_Process/8B_sam2fastq/F1_23_1 and /mnt/shared/scratch/vlitzke//kitchenflies/DNA/2_Process/8B_sam2fastq/F1_23_2
This looks like paired data from lane 841.
